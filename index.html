<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Currently, I am working as a Lead Engineer at <a href="https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html">Eaton Research Labs, Eaton Corporation, USA</a> with focus on planning, sizing, and control of EV charging stations and DC distribution system. Before joining Eaton, I worked at <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/">Lucid Motors Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla Inc.</a> where I contributed to projects related to machine learning applications, home energy management, and design of solar, battery, and EV charging stations for commercial applications. I received Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.mst.edu/">Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&amp;T), USA</a> in 2023. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc degrees in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://web.uettaxila.edu.pk/">University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Taxila, Pakistan</a> respectively in 2012 and 2017. I also received 
a second M.Sc. degree in Nuclear Engineering from <a href="http://www.pieas.edu.pk/">Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)</a> in 2015. <br /> I'm a recipient of <a href="https://news.mst.edu/2023/05/sts-college-of-engineering-and-computing-honors-high-achieving-ph-d-students/"><i>2023 CEC Dean’s PhD Scholar Award</i></a> at Missouri S&amp;T. I'm also a recipient of the <a href="https://econnection.mst.edu/2021/09/paper-on-fast-charging-stations-named-best-conference-paper/"><i>Best Conference Paper Award</i></a> 
and the <a href="https://econnection.mst.edu/2021/10/ph-d-student-earns-second-place-in-global-poster-contest/"><i>Second Prize</i></a> in the graduate poster competition at the IEEE PES General Meeting, USA 2021. I authored/co-authored 10 journal papers, 10 conference papers, 02 IP disclosures, 02 IPs (filed).</p>
