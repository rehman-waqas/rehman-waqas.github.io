== About Me
I am currently a Ph.D candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA. 
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc degrees in Electrical Engineering from [https://web.uettaxila.edu.pk/ University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Taxila, Pakistan] respectively in 2012 and 2017. I also received 
a second M.Sc. degree in Nuclear Engineering from [http://www.pieas.edu.pk/ Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)] in 2015. I'm a recipient of the [https://econnection.mst.edu/2021/09/paper-on-fast-charging-stations-named-best-conference-paper/ /Best Conference Paper Award/] 
and the [https://econnection.mst.edu/2021/10/ph-d-student-earns-second-place-in-global-poster-contest/ /Second Prize/] in the graduate poster competition at the IEEE PES General Meeting, USA 2021. My current research interests are optimal siting, sizing, operation and control 
of [https://news.mst.edu/2018/10/missouri-st-researchers-win-multimillion-dollar-grant-to-build-fast-charging-stations-for-electric-cars/ Extreme Fast Charging (XFC) Stations] and Superchargers for electric vehicles. I am also interested in applying machine learning and AI methods in power and energy systems.
